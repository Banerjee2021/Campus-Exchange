Above are the files MarketPlace.jsx, routes/products.js, models/Product.js, index.js and context/AuthContext.jsx. I want that the MarketPlace.jsx will retrieve the data from the mongoDb server in the form of Cards. Each Card will display the image of the product, product name as a heading, description of the product, price of the product, contact of the seller and rest all the necessary details from the products collection in the mongoDb database. In the Marketplace the contents should be divided into rows and each row will contain three cards each. The justify content will be space around. Also when we scroll down the page the cards will have an animation. In the card after all the details there will be one button. First button will be named as message the seller. 


1. When a user is not logged they cannot access the marketplace and if they try to click on the marketplace link it will redirect them to Login.jsx. After they login they can access the marketplace.

2. After the user is logged in and click on any card in the marketplace it will zoom in the image provided by the seller. The image will have a cross button at the top right corner that will close the zoomed in image. 

3 Also the Card will contain the details which user has uploaded the product. For that it will display the user name from the database. So make this changes in the models/Product.js to display the name of the user who uploaded the product. And also the name will also be shown in the marketplace a long with the rest other details.  

Make sure that all the file s shoulbe in jsx or js format.
